###### LB Nagar
LB Nagar is a ring road where too much vehicles were pass away and there is a hotel **kirthunga** where we can find a **Delicious** food.

Way to My favorite food location
1. Go to shamshabad
2. Take a bus
    1.  Travel from shamshabad to L.B. Nagar
    8. On the right side of the Bus Station  there is a restaurant called krithunga

# Graphs Spanning/Cycles/Ancestor
###### Spanning Tree
A tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. It is a spanning tree of a graph G if it spans G (that is, it includes every vertex of G) and is a subgraph of G (every edge in the tree belongs to G).

###### Cycle
In graph theory, a cycle in a graph is a non-empty trail in which only the first and last vertices are equal. A directed cycle in a directed graph is a non-empty directed trail in which only the first and last vertices are equal.

###### Lowest Common Ancestor
In graph theory and computer science, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) (also called least common ancestor) of two nodes v and w in a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) T is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants, where we define each node to be a descendant of itself (so if v has a direct
