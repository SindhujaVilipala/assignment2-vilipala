# Graphs Spanning

> In combinatorial mathematics, the Prüfer sequence (also Prüfer code or Prüfer numbers) of a labeled tree is a unique sequence associated with the tree. The sequence for a tree on n vertices has length n − 2, and can be generated by a simple iterative algorithm. Prüfer sequences were first used by Heinz Prüfer to prove Cayley's formula in 1918.[1]

vector<vector<int>> adj;

vector<int> pruefer_code() {
    int n = adj.size();
    set<int> leafs;
    vector<int> degree(n);
    vector<bool> killed(n, false);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        degree[i] = adj[i].size();
        if (degree[i] == 1)
            leafs.insert(i);
    }

    vector<int> code(n - 2);
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
        int leaf = *leafs.begin();
        leafs.erase(leafs.begin());
        killed[leaf] = true;

        int v;
        for (int u : adj[leaf]) {
            if (!killed[u])
                v = u;
        }

        code[i] = v;
        if (--degree[v] == 1)
            leafs.insert(v);
    }

    return code;
